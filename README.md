# UWB

Implementing UWB with bluetooth

1. *Add Permissions:**

- In your app's AndroidManifest.xml file, include the necessary permissions for UWB functionality.
  This may include permissions for Bluetooth, Bluetooth Admin, and location access.

2. **UWB Library Integration:**

    - If required, add any UWB libraries or SDKs to your project. Refer to the library's
      documentation for installation instructions.

3. **Device Discovery:**

    - Implement a device discovery feature in your app. This feature should allow your app to scan
      for nearby UWB-enabled devices and display them to users. Make the discovery process
      user-friendly.

4. **Connection Establishment:**

    - Develop a secure method for initiating connections with selected UWB devices. Ensure that
      these connections are established securely to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Transaction Flow:**

    - Create screens or interfaces for users to input transaction details, such as the transfer
      amount and recipient information.

6. **Transaction Confirmation:**

    - Implement a mechanism for users to review and confirm their transactions. Provide feedback,
      such as a "Transaction Successful" screen, for both the sender and recipient upon transaction
      completion.
